How to play:
Type "python Pacman.py" in the terminal.
Use following keys to move the pacman:
	a=left
	s=down
	d=right
	w=up

Rules:
If Pacman/Ghost strikes the wall or boundaries of the board then it stops moving until you try to moe it in the opposite direction(i.e. if position of P is (0,3) then we cannot move it by pressing 'a' but we can use any one of the other three).
If Ghost catches a coin it(coin) is destroyed.
